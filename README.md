# Countdown-Timer-from-Scratch---JavaScript-ProjectThe Countdown Timer from Scratch project is a dynamic web-based application built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It displays a countdown to a specified date and time, showing the remaining days, hours, minutes, and seconds. The user interface features a visually appealing background with a semi-transparent overlay, and clearly labeled input fields that automatically update every second to reflect the time left. This project demonstrates key JavaScript concepts like date manipulation, DOM updating, and interval functions, while also showcasing skills in responsive design and styling with CSS for an engaging user experience.
